Jenna is playing a computer game involving a large map with n cities numbered sequentially from 1 to n that are connected by m bidirectional roads. 
The game's objective is to travel to as many cities as possible without visiting any city more than once. The more cities the player visits, the more points they earn. As Jenna's fellow student at Hackerland University, she asks you for help choosing an optimal path. Given the map, can you help her find a path that maximizes her score?

Note: She can start and end her path at any two distinct cities.
