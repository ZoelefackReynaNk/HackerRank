Objective
Today we will expand our knowledge of strings, combining it with what we have already learned about loops. 
Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

Task.
Given a string, S, of length  N that is indexed from  to 0 to N-1, 
print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

Example: S = adbecf


Print abc def
